Robert Gitari 

I currently have 2 projects :

    Project 1: Markowitz Portfolio Optimization (in R)
    Project 2: Empirically testing CAPM
    
Projects will range from Asset Allocation, Option Pricing to Risk. 
The data comes from various sources during my time studying Business Analytics at the Fuqua School of Business, so not all data will be publicly availabe although I will link data which is.
