Robert Gitari 

I currently have 2 projects :

    Project 1: Markowitz Portfolio Optimization (in R)
    Project 2: Empirical Tests of Various Asset Pricing Models
    Project 3: Macroeconomic Regimes and Asset Returns - Creating An All Weather Portfolio
    Project 4: Option Pricing
    Project 5: Dynamic Hedging in R
    

    
Projects will range from Asset Allocation, Option Pricing to Risk. 
The data comes from various sources during my time studying Business Analytics at the Fuqua School of Business, so not all data will be publicly availabe although I will link data which is.
